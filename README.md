# Planned Enhancements

Create a homework tracker application wherein users create an account, make lists of assignments, and create and edit their homework assignments. 

Add an introduction page that allows users the choice of logging in if they already have an account or signing up for one.  

Add a "create an account" option on the login option page to prevent users from having to backtrack and start the process from the beginning. 

Create a "to-do table" table that includes the subject name, assignment description, and due date. 

Add the ability to delete assignments once completed and update if partially complete. 

Add additional objects for Assignment, Subject and Date Due.
